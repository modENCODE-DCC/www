<h3>modENCODE Reagent Distribution</h3>


As it proceeds with its primary goal of data collection, the modENCODE Consortium will produce numerous new reagents (clones, strains, antibodies) and copious data about important, existing reagents.  It is our plan to make both reagents and information publicly available to the extent practicable.

To this end we are:
<ul>
<li>Devising a policy for depositing clones and strains in public repositories.

<li>Collecting detailed quality control information on commercially available antibodies being used by modENCODE.  This information will be assembled and published on the modENCODE web sites.

<li>Considering guidelines for the distribution of non-renewable reagents (e.g. new antibodies).

</ul>
While formal policies are being considered many reagents and much information are available now, and investigators are welcome to direct inquiries to the individual laboratories that are using and/or developing them.
