 The packaging of DNA into chromatin and chromosomes has major implications for understanding how genome sequences function in eukaryotic cells. We propose to participate in the ENCODE project by determining the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins and histone modifications across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins and modifications under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) with antibodies obtained commercially and generated and validated by this project, isolate and label the precipitated DNA, and apply the probes to genomic tiling arrays. Data generated by scanning the hybridized arrays will be analyzed by statistical methods, and the array data will be validated by independent analyses in cells and animals. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages. We will perform a variety of bioinformatic comparisons between protein &quot;landscape&quot; data sets, including analyses of combinatorial patterns of modifications and chromosomal proteins, tissue-specific differences, and interactions among proteins involved in the same epigenetic pathways. All validated data and analyses will be made available to members of the ENCODE project and the scientific community. Successful completion of this project will provide basic information about the distributions of chromatin components across the Drosophila genome, which will serve as a foundation for future functional studies. The data and analysis are very likely to provide information critical to understanding the roles of chromatin packaging in human cells, and the mispackaging that can be associated with disease.
