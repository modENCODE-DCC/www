<h2>Embryo collection/fixing for ChIP-chip</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Grow worms on 10-20 10 cm plates. After starving on plates, add concentrated  <em>E Coli</em> (HB101) grown to saturation, then resuspended in <a href="./m9-buffer.shtml">M9 Buffer</a>+20%glycerol at equal weight:volume) to obtain as many adults with embryos. Bleach to obtain embryos as described previously 1.   </li>
 <li>Transfer embryos in <a href="./m9-buffer.shtml">M9 Buffer</a> to plates to hatch overnight or in <a href="./m9-buffer.shtml">M9 Buffer</a> shaking overnight to obtain L1s. Wash L1s and put into 500 ml liquid media (S medium+1X PSN antibiotics and nystatin) and grow at 20 oC in an incubator shaking at 230 rpm (2.8 lt Fernbach flasks perform the best). Add concentrated <em>E Coli</em> for food as necessary during growth. It takes around 2.5-3 days to obtain adults with embryos. </li>
 <li>Collect adults (by filtration over 35uM nitex membrane) and transfer to 50 ml conical tubes. To 5-10 ml of worms add 40 ml of <a href="./bleaching-solution.shtml">Bleaching Solution</a> and mix for approximately 8-12  minutes while monitoring bleaching as described (1). </li>
 <li>Spin down embryos at 3000 g for 3 minutes. Resuspend pellet (embryos) in 50 ml <a href="./m9-buffer.shtml">M9 Buffer</a> and spin 3000 g for 3 minutes. Repeat this wash 2 more times. </li>
 <li>Resuspend embryos in 47 ml <a href="./m9-buffer.shtml">M9 Buffer</a> and add 2.8 ml 37% formaldehyde solution. Place on a shaker (50-100 rpm) and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT, between 22-26 oC).  </li>
 <li>Wash embryos with once with 50 ml 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 (to quench excess formaldehyde), 2 times with 50 ml <a href="./m9-buffer.shtml">M9 Buffer</a>, and once with 10 ml FA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Calbiochem Cat# 539131, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set I).  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Collect embryos in microfuge tubes by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10s  Discard supernatant and store the embryo pellet at -80 oC.
