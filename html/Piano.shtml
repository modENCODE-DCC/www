The 3&#39; untranslated region (3&#39; UTR) constitutes a major site of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Sequence elements in the 3&#39; UTR interact with trans-acting regulators such as microRNAs that affect translation and stability. Deciphering the global interactions among these sequence elements will open a new window into gene regulatory networks. However, mapping these interactions in vivo will require detailed cell- or tissue-type specific data as well as new methods for in vivo validation studies. To obtain molecular resolution of these sequence elements in a living organism at a genomic scale, we need to develop and implement new methods and explore their use for large-scale analyses. We are thus proposing to conduct a pilot project toward building a comprehensive dynamic view of the "3&#39; UTRome" in the context of animal development in the model organism <i>C. elegans</i>. Our overall aims are to: 1. Pilot a 3&#39;RACE-cloning-sequencing strategy to identify the 3&#39; UTRs of ~6,000 transcripts and explore their heterogeneity. 2. Pilot new technology to map temporal and tissue-specific profiles of small RNAs and mRNAs in <i>C. elegans</i>. 3. Pilot an in vivo system to test elements that mediate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.
